# Lab 11: Encrypting Large Message#
# Task:
## 1.  Encrypt and Decrypt Text file.
First create text file named plain.txt with the following content: `My name is Manh` by command `cat > plain.txt`. Then use the `ls` command to check and see that file `plain.txt` has been created.

<img width="726" alt="lab 11 2.png"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ec65f0d-3a10-4ed9-b778-3dd6dd962258"><br>

Encrypt plain.txt, view the encrypted file with xxd then decrypt it with different aes cipher, in different modes

For ecb:

To encrypt need to use this command: `openssl enc -aes-256-ecb -nosalt -in plain.txt -out ecb_encrypted.txt -K 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF` and then we can see the encrypted file

For cbc:

To encrypt need to use this command:  `openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -nosalt -in plain.txt -out cbc_encrypted.txt -K 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF -iv 0102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F10 `and then we can see the encrypted file

<img width="726" alt="lab 11 5.png"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e001b514-db8e-4061-9440-ec0e43ac8b86"><br>

To decrypt need to use this command:  `openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -nosalt -in cbc_encrypted.txt -out cbc_decrypted.txt -K 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF -iv 0102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F10` and the we can see the decrypted file

## 2.  Encryption Mode – ECB vs. CBC.
Encrypt the file using the ECB (Electronic Code Book) and CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) modes

CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) modes::

use command: `dd if=origin.bmp of=header.bin bs=1 count=54` 

<img width="726" alt="lab 11 8.png"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/baa1aaff-e42c-4869-914d-712ce78d6409"><br>

<img width="726" alt="lab 11 9.png"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/001b41d1-f290-4c00-8adb-fa9ebd47e4d6"><br>

use command: `dd if=origin.bmp of=body.bin bs=1 skip=54`

<img width="726" alt="lab 11 10.png"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7dabf2fb-24d7-42c8-8122-a1fb20f00d0b"><br>

<img width="726" alt="lab 11 11.png"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8d0bc44-3ae2-4ce9-97e4-57c89db12dd3"><br>

Use these command to take the key K and iv

<img width="726" alt="lab 11 14.png"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2066ce9e-a5d0-4f7d-a906-f9b78373a687"><br>

=> We can insert random value from key.bin and iv.bin to arguments KEY and IV.

and then use this command to encrypt: `openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -nosalt -in body.bin -out encrypted_body.bin -K [KEY] -iv [IV]` and this command `cat header.bin encrypted_body.bin > partially_encrypted.bmp`

<img width="726" alt="lab 11 15.png"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c783c94e-eefe-472f-8a74-10702a228c5c"><br>

Now open the partically_encrypted.bmp file we can see:

<img width="726" alt="lab 11 16.png"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86cd6ac4-196d-432d-ad5f-9bcce3195713"><br>

+ When viewing an encrypted image, it appears significantly more random compared to the original. You won't be able to discern any recognizable patterns in the encrypted version. In essence, it resembles random noise, devoid of any identifiable structures or patterns from the original image.

+ CBC mode achieves this by guaranteeing that identical plaintext blocks always produce different ciphertext blocks. This is thanks to its chaining mechanism. This property makes CBC mode more resistant to pattern analysis, leading to stronger confidentiality for encrypted data that contains repeating patterns, commonly found in images. 

- ECB (Electronic Code Book) modes:

<img width="726" alt="lab 11 17.png"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44e36a92-4efa-49b6-b708-946de6997745"><br>

Use these command to take the key K and iv:

<img width="726" alt="lab 11 18.png"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21d6ed81-f6d0-45cf-8e87-94651feb605a"><br>

and then use this command to encrypt:

<img width="726" alt="lab 11 19.png"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b574c6d-6ac9-4f67-9503-0b0f9a3422ef"><br>

Open the `partically_encrypted_ecb.bmp` file we see:

<img width="726" alt="lab 11 20.png"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e4f9ad4-13d8-49cd-8906-61ff5da17da4"><br>

+ Even after encryption, the resulting image isn't completely obscured. Certain patterns from the original image might still be visible. These could appear as repeating blocks that hint at the original structure. In essence, some visual information about the original image can be gleaned despite the encryption.

+ ECB mode is unsuitable for encrypting data containing repeating patterns. This is because identical blocks of plain text are always encrypted into identical blocks of ciphertext. This can expose patterns in the ciphertext, potentially enabling an attacker to partially decrypt or reverse engineer the original data.

Conclusion: By comparing the two encrypted images, we should see that:

+ ECB Mode: The encrypted image retains some patterns and can reveal visual information about the original image. This demonstrates that ECB mode is not suitable for encrypting images or other data with repeating patterns.
+ CBC Mode: The encrypted image appears random and does not reveal any useful information about the original image. This demonstrates that CBC mode provides better security and confidentiality for such data.

## 3. Encryption Mode – Corrupted Cipher Text.

To understand the properties of various encryption modes, do the following tasks: 

1. Create a text file that is at least 64 bytes long.

<img width="726" alt="lab 11 21.png"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0202e50e-abaa-475f-a0f9-53de686d79c3"><br>

2. Encrypt the file using the AES-256 cipher.

<img width="726" alt="lab 11 22.png"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11edecca-813c-47f6-92ba-a5e78d5dde9f"><br>

3. A single bit of the 5th byte in the encrypted file presumably got corrupted, you can achieve his corruption using dd command.

<img width="726" alt="lab 11 23.png"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9de0f35f-2a79-45f4-8a56-ad4ef5168705"><br>

4. Decrypt the corrupted file (encrypted) using the correct key and IV. Please answer the following questions: 

<img width="726" alt="lab 11 24.png"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05b071dc-50b6-4723-958f-43ea7e4fbeeb"><br>

a. How much information can you recover by decrypting the corrupted file, if the encryption mode is ECB, CBC, CFB, or OFB, respectively? Please answer this question before you conduct this task, and then find out whether your answer is correct or wrong after you finish this task.

+ ECB (Electronic Code Book): Corruption of one byte will affect only that byte. The rest of the data will be correctly decrypted.
+ CBC (Cipher Block Chaining): Corruption of one byte will affect the current block and the subsequent block due to the chaining mechanism.
+ CFB (Cipher Feedback): Corruption of one byte will affect the current byte and the subsequent bytes in the stream.
+ OFB (Output Feedback): Corruption of one byte will affect only that byte. The rest of the data will be correctly decrypted.

b. Explain

ECB Mode:

+ As ECB mode encrypts data in individual blocks, a corrupted 5th byte will only impact itself. The remaining plaintext should decrypt without errors.

CBC Mode:

+ In CBC mode, if a single byte is corrupted in the 5th position of a ciphertext block, the entire block will be garbled. This error will also spill over and corrupt the following block because of the XOR operation with the previous block's ciphertext.

CFB Mode:

+ In CFB mode, if the 5th byte is corrupted, it will alter the corresponding byte in the plaintext and cause errors in all following bytes in the data stream.  In OFB mode... (the passage continues about OFB mode)

In OFB mode, corruption in a single byte of the ciphertext only impacts that specific byte in the decrypted plaintext. This advantage stems from the mode's use of the encrypted output, rather than the original plaintext, to generate the keystream. As a result, the remaining bytes remain unaffected and decrypt correctly.

c. What is the implication of these differences?

The differences in how each mode handles errors have important implications for their use:

ECB Mode: While ECB mode can handle localized data corruption (errors affecting only specific parts), it's not ideal for encrypting data with patterns. This is because identical blocks of plain text will always turn into identical blocks of ciphertext, revealing patterns in the original data. However, ECB's ability to recover from errors within individual blocks might be beneficial in situations where occasional localized corruption is acceptable.

CBC Mode: While CBC mode offers improved security for patterned data, it suffers from error propagation. This implies that a single error can corrupt multiple data blocks, rendering it less ideal for scenarios where error correction or data integrity is paramount.

CFB Mode: Like CBC mode, CFB mode is susceptible to error propagation, meaning errors can impact following bytes. However, it's commonly used for stream encryption where its feedback mechanism offers advantages.

OFB Mode: OFB mode does not propagate errors, making it suitable for situations where error recovery is important. It is similar to CFB mode but does not feedback the ciphertext into the encryption process, making it more resilient to bit errors.

Conclusion: By following these procedures and analyzing the results, you'll gain insight into how different encryption modes handle errors. This understanding will help you choose the most appropriate mode for specific applications.
