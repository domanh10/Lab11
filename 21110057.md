# Lab 11: Encrypting Large Message#
# Task:
## 1.  Encrypt and Decrypt Text file.
First create text file named plain.txt with the following content: `My name is Manh` by command `cat > plain.txt`. Then use the `ls` command to check and see that file `plain.txt` has been created.

Encrypt plain.txt, view the encrypted file with xxd then decrypt it with different aes cipher, in different modes

For ecb:

To encrypt need to use this command: `openssl enc -aes-256-ecb -nosalt -in plain.txt -out ecb_encrypted.txt -K 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF` and then we can see the encrypted file

To decrypt need to use this command: `openssl enc -d -aes-256-ecb -nosalt -in ecb_encrypted.txt -out ecb_decrypted.txt -K 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF` and the we can see the decrypted file

For cbc:

To encrypt need to use this command:  `openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -nosalt -in plain.txt -out cbc_encrypted.txt -K 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF -iv 0102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F10 `and then we can see the encrypted file

To decrypt need to use this command:  `openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -nosalt -in cbc_encrypted.txt -out cbc_decrypted.txt -K 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF -iv 0102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F10` and the we can see the decrypted file
